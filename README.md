(Micro)blogging.

What made sites like Twitter nice was that it was easy to quickly write something down and later be able to find it back.
For example, say you have just read a nice blog post and want to remember it for later, you could just tweet it.
However, X (formerly Twitter) and most other social media platforms have been locking everything down.
Most posts can now only be viewed when you are logged in.

fx is a simple (micro)blogging server that you can easily host yourself.
